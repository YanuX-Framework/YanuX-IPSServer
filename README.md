# Indoor Positioning Server
This is part of the [__YanuX Framework__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/). It is the server-side component of our __Indoor Positioning Solution__ for the [__YanuX Framework__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/).

It is built in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to provide a __REST API__ that the __Indoor Positioning Clients__ can use to submit scanning information.

The server can then decide which positioning methods and techniques should be used to determine the absolute and/or relative position of the devices based on the information received from the clients running on them. 

The decision engine is built using __fuzzy logic__ using [__scikit-fuzzy__](https://github.com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy). Most of the employed data analysis and machine learning algorithms come from [__scikit-learn__](https://scikit-learn.org/).

A [__WAMP__](https://wamp-proto.org/) Router ([__Crossbar.io__](https://crossbar.io/)) also runs besides the __REST API__ itself. It is responsible for receiving positioning events generated by the calls made by the __Indoor Positioning Clients__  to the __REST API__ and forwarding them to any [__WAMP__](https://wamp-proto.org/) clients that have subscribed to those events, e.g., the [__YanuX IPS Bridge__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-IPSBridge).
